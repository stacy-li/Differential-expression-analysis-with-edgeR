# Differential-expression-analysis-with-edgeR
The code in the Jupyter Notebook is part of the work of the group project in BST281: Genomics Data Manipulation at HSPH. The code contains the differential expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes resulting from targeting Pdx1 gene in transgenic mice compared to those in the untargeted control group using edgeR.
